# DORN.pytorch

This is done when I was just post graduated and the author of DORN only opensourced a inference demo. According the inference code, I made this ordinal regresion loss using a way like multi binary classification.

I can get convinced result in monocular depth estimation task. This code may be used in a commercial image processing service or tool.
